on day 1, Bob stakes 10 tokens for 6 months
Bob gets 10*6 "units"

On day 31, Bob stakes 10 tokens, for 5 monhts
Bob gets 10*5 "units"

So now bob has 20 tokens, worth 110 units unlocking at the end of the original 6 months. 

If he withdraws only 10 tokens, he should lose 55 units



Bob could decide to add "1 month" to his lock.
This would give him 20 extra units (total 130 units worth)  


You get "1 unit per token/month" 


Pierre  20 
Henry   30 
Fran    60

Total   110

flowrate of 10023232 tokens / second

100 / 110 = flowrate per unit
100 / 110 * 60 = fran's flowrate



66% $1M mcap

if a token reaches $1M mcap, then 66% * 500'000'000 could be staked
330'000'000 could be staked.
